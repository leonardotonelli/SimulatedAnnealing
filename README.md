# Exploring Discrete Landscape Optimization: Simulated Annealing vs. Greedy Strategy

The project aims to explore the landscape defined by a discrete function represented by a matrix of numbers, where each element corresponds to a combination of two variables (column and row). The objective is to minimize this function using optimization techniques. Initially, the project implements simulated annealing and compares its performance with a greedy strategy. Subsequently, it devises a stochastic efficient process to expedite the optimization process.
