# Exploring Discrete Landscape Optimization: Simulated Annealing vs. Greedy Strategy

The project aims to explore the landscape defined by a discrete function represented by a matrix of numbers, where each element corresponds to a combination of two variables (column and row). The objective is to minimize this function using optimization techniques. Initially, the project implements simulated annealing and compares its performance with a greedy strategy. Subsequently, it devises a stochastic efficient process to expedite the optimization process.

To Run the whole Notebook takes around 15 minutes(there are 2/3 lines that make 80% of that time), if this is a problem you can still access all the codes and observations but you will need to open the GRAPH word document to see the figures referred in the notebook.
